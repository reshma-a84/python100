Instructions
You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called weather_f that takes each temperature in degrees Celsius and converts it into degrees Fahrenheit.

To convert temp_c into temp_f:

(temp_c * 9/5) + 32 = temp_f

Do NOT Create a dictionary directly. Try to use Dictionary Comprehension instead of a Loop.
