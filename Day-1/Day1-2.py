# print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")


print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")                          #end double quote missing
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')      #Replace " with '
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')                       # Indentation wrong
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")       # Remove double parentheses from the beginning
